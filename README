Very minimal personal journaling system.

The entries/ directory is used to store files that look like:
    1.journal
    2.journal
    etc

Running "bash journal.sh" will:
* find the highest-numbered entry in the entries/ folder
* open vim in a new entry with a new highest number

You will need to make journal.py executable, like:
`chmod +x journal.py`

Also I recommend aliasing, eg add the following line to your ~/.bashrc file:
`alias journal="bash /path/to/here/journal.sh"`
